#In this Task, I created the simple blockchain with mining and validation check using Java Programming language.
Blockchain is a distributed ledger technology that underpins cryptocurrencies. 
- Blockchain operates in a decentralized manner, meaning there is no central authority, institution, or single point of control. Instead, it relies on a network of nodes that work collectively. This decentralization enhances security and reduces the risk of manipulation. 
- Blockchain maintains a distributed ledger, which is a shared and synchronized database containing a record of all transactions. Each node in the network maintains a copy of the entire blockchain. New transactions are added to all copies of the ledger, and consensus mechanisms ensure that all copies stay in sync.
- Once data is recorded on the blockchain, it is nearly impossible to alter or delete. The cryptographic link between blocks (using the previous block's hash in the current block) ensures that any change to a block would require changing all subsequent blocks, which is computationally infeasible.
